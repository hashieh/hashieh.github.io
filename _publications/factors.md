**Abstract**: Do Chinese monetary policy announcements matter? This study evaluates how relevant Chinese monetary policy announcements are to Chinese financial markets and the real side of the economy. Chinese monetary policy is identified by estimating a “target” factor measuring policy surprises and a “path” factor measuring future expectations of policy using price changes to Chinese financial derivatives on policy announcement dates. Local projection results show that 1) Chinese Treasury yields and interbank rates respond persistently, suggesting that policy transmission through an interest-rate channel exists; 2) Equities and exchange rates do not respond to policy announcements instantaneously, but with a lag; 3) Future expectations of Chinese monetary policy play a larger role than surprises, 4) Real variables show evidence of policy transmission, and 5) policy transmission may be sticky due to information frictions.
