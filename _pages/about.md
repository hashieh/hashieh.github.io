**I will be joining the Vassar College Economics Department as an Assistant Professor starting Fall 2024.**

I am an applied macroeconomist with research interests that lie at the intersection of monetary economics, macrofinance, and international finance. I was a Dissertation Fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 2022. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of California at Santa Cruz.  Prior to UC Santa Cruz, I received my BA in Economics from UC Irvine and my MA in Economics at CSU Fullerton.
