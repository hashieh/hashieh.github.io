<p>I am currently an Assistant Professor at Vassar College and a Research Affiliate at the Center for Analytical Finance at UC Santa Cruz (CAFIN). I am an applied macroeconomist with research interests that lie at the intersection of monetary economics, macrofinance, international finance, and the Chinese Economy. My current projects focus on central bank communications, the transmission of monetary policy, its relationship with financial markets, and the role global value chains play in the transmission of monetary policy, where recent projects primarily work on issues related to the identification of Chinese monetary policy shocks, tracing the global spillovers of Chinese monetary policy, examining the development and growth of shadow finance in China, as well as exploring Indian monetary policy and financial markets.</p>

<p>I was a Dissertation Fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 2022. In addition to my research, I am an award winning educator (The Milamâ€‘McGintyâ€‘Kaun Award for Excellence in Teaching â€” Social Sciences Division, UC Santa Cruz) with extensive higher-education teaching experience in both in-person and remote modalities.</p>

<p>I received my PhD in Economics from the University of California at Santa Cruz.  Prior to UC Santa Cruz, I received my BA in Economics from UC Irvine and my MA in Economics at CSU Fullerton.</p>
